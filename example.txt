About Artificial Intelligence (AI)
What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that enables machines to simulate human intelligence. AI systems can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Types of AI:
1.Narrow AI (Weak AI) – AI designed for specific tasks (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant, ChatGPT).
2.General AI (Strong AI) – Hypothetical AI with human-like intelligence, capable of reasoning and problem-solving across various domains.
3.Super AI – A futuristic AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.

Key AI Technologies:
1.Machine Learning (ML): AI that learns from data and improves over time (e.g., recommendation systems).
2.Deep Learning: A subset of ML using neural networks for tasks like image recognition and speech processing.
3.Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables machines to understand and generate human language (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Translate).
4.Computer Vision: Allows machines to interpret images and videos (e.g., facial recognition, self-driving cars).

Applications of AI:
1.Healthcare (diagnosis, drug discovery)
2.Finance (fraud detection, stock predictions)
3.Autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars)
4.Robotics (AI-powered robots in industries)
5.Virtual Assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
